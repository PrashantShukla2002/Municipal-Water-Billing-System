Frontend scaffold for Municipal Water Bill Payments

Folder structure included in this zip:
- public/index.html
- src/components/*
- src/pages/*
- src/services/api.js
- src/App.js, src/index.js
- package.json, tailwind.config.js

Notes:
- This is a minimal, ready-to-expand scaffold. Replace API endpoints with your backend.
- Configure runtime base URL by editing public/index.html (window.__APP_CONFIG__.API_BASE) or set REACT_APP_API_BASE at build time.
- To run locally (CRA style):
  1) npm install
  2) npm start

If you want, I can now:
- Generate a mock Express backend matching the API used.
- Split the components into TypeScript and add unit tests.
